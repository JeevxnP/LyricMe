This is Y13's application called 'Lyric Me'. It is essenially a forum for identifying the artists and names of songs that you dont know.

Our application is focused on the user producing a short clip of the song by singing or humming it.

Other users would then comment if they have any ideas as to what the artist or name of the song is.


This is my group's project for the "First Year Team Project" course unit in first year of university (course code COMP10120).
